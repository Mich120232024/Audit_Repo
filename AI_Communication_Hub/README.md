# AI Communication Hub

This directory serves as the central hub for organizing AI communication across workspaces.

## Directory Structure

- `schemas/`: Message schemas and conventions
- `connectors/`: Integration code for various AI services
- `logs/`: Archived communication logs
- `workspaces/`: Information about individual AI workspaces

## Purpose

This hub implements our disciplined approach to AI communication focusing on:

1. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Standardized identifiers for AI workspaces
2. **Structured Message Formats**: Clear content and metadata organization
3. **Proper Introductions**: Templates for workspace self-identification
4. **Context Maintenance**: Guidelines for preserving context across conversations

## Core Principles

- **Minimalism**: Focus on discipline and organization over tooling complexity
- **Clarity**: Unambiguous communication patterns that any AI can understand
- **Persistence**: Maintain context and history for meaningful interactions
- **Interoperability**: Support communication across different AI platforms and IDEs
