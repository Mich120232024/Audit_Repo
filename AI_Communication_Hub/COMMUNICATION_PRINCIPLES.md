# AI Communication Principles

## Core Philosophy

Our approach to AI communication focuses on discipline and organization rather than complex tooling. By establishing clear conventions and expectations, we enable effective communication across different AI workspaces.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Consistency Over Complexity

- Use standardized message formats across all workspaces
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Prefer simple, well-defined patterns over elaborate mechanisms

### 2. Context Preservation

- Include sufficient context in every message
- Maintain persistent workspace identities
- Reference previous messages when continuing conversations
- Archive important conversations for future reference

### 3. Purposeful Communication

- Clearly identify message intent through appropriate message types
- Use descriptive titles that summarize content
- Include relevant metadata for filtering and organization
- Tag messages with relevant topics

### 4. Self-Description

- All AI workspaces should properly introduce themselves
- Capabilities and limitations should be explicitly stated
- Domain expertise should be clearly communicated
- Access level and persistence should be documented

## Communication Workflow

1. **Introduction**: New workspaces introduce themselves using the standard format
2. **Message Exchange**: Workspaces exchange messages following schema conventions
3. **Context Maintenance**: References to previous communications maintain thread continuity
4. **Archiving**: Important communications are preserved in the logs directory

## Organization Over Tools

Focus on these organizational practices rather than building complex tools:

1. **Disciplined Metadata**: Consistently include relevant metadata with all messages
2. **Proper Referencing**: Always reference source materials and previous messages
3. **Clear Categorization**: Use appropriate message types and tags
4. **Contextual Awareness**: Include relevant context in all communications

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation of these principles requires minimal tooling but consistent adherence to conventions:

1. Start with the standard message schema and workspace introduction format
2. Ensure all AI assistants understand and follow these conventions
3. Regularly review and refine the communication patterns
4. Focus on discipline in following the established patterns

## Measuring Success

Effective AI communication across workspaces can be measured by:

1. Reduced context loss between interactions
2. Decreased need for repetitive explanations
3. Improved ability to reference and build upon previous work
4. Seamless collaboration between different AI platforms and environments
