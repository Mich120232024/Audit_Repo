# Azure Service Bus Deployment for Inter-IDE Communication Framework

**Date**: May 12, 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**Project**: Inter_IDE_Communication_Framework  

## Deployment Summary

An Azure Service Bus infrastructure has been successfully deployed to support the Inter_IDE_Communication_Framework project. This messaging service enables reliable communication between different IDE instances (VS Code and Cursor) with a focus on end-of-day governance audit functionality.

## Resource Details

### Azure Resources Created

1. **Resource Group**:
   - Name: `inter-ide-rg`
   - Location: East US
   - ID: `/subscriptions/6f928fec-8d15-47d7-b27b-be8b568e9789/resourceGroups/inter-ide-rg`

2. **Service Bus Namespace**:
   - Name: `inter-ide-servicebus`
   - Tier: Premium
   - Location: East US
   - Endpoint: `https://inter-ide-servicebus.servicebus.windows.net:443/`

3. **Topics and Subscriptions**:

   | Topic Name | Subscription Name | Purpose |
   |------------|-------------------|---------|
   | governance-audits | cursor-governance-sub | End-of-day governance audit reports for Cursor |
   | governance-audits | vscode-governance-sub | End-of-day governance audit reports for VS Code |
   | ide-communication | cursor-ide-sub | Direct IDE-to-IDE messaging for Cursor |
   | ide-communication | vscode-ide-sub | Direct IDE-to-IDE messaging for VS Code |

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows Azure best practices with:
- Premium tier for high-throughput requirements
- Duplicate detection enabled (10-minute window)
- Session support for maintaining conversation context
- Microsoft Entra ID authentication (no connection strings)

## Integration Instructions for Cursor

### Connection Information
- **Namespace**: `inter-ide-servicebus.servicebus.windows.net`
- **Authentication**: Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- **Topics**: 
  - `governance-audits` - For end-of-day audit reports
  - `ide-communication` - For direct communication with VS Code

### Integration Code Example

```typescript
// Example TypeScript code for Cursor integration
import { ServiceBusClient } from "@azure/service-bus";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

// Use managed identity for authentication (secure, no credentials in code)
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const sbClient = new ServiceBusClient(
  "inter-ide-servicebus.servicebus.windows.net",
  credential
);

// Create sender for governance audits
const governanceSender = sbClient.createSender("governance-audits");

// Create receiver for listening to IDE communications
const ideReceiver = sbClient.createReceiver("ide-communication", "cursor-ide-sub");

// Function to send end-of-day audit
async function sendEndOfDayAudit(auditData) {
  await governanceSender.sendMessages({
    body: auditData,
    contentType: "application/json",
    subject: "end-of-day-audit"
  });
  console.log("End-of-day audit sent successfully");
}

// Process incoming messages from other IDEs
async function processMessages() {
  ideReceiver.subscribe({
    processMessage: async (message) => {
      console.log(`Received message: ${message.body}`);
      // Process message from other IDEs
    },
    processError: async (err) => {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });
  console.log("Now listening for messages from other IDEs");
}
```

## Message Schema

For governance audit messages:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-12T06:00:00Z",
  "source": "cursor",
  "auditType": "end-of-day",
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "security",
      "level": "warning",
      "description": "Potential credential exposure in commit abc123",
      "location": "file.js:25"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "3 warnings, 0 critical issues found"
}
```

## Next Steps for Cursor Implementation

1. Implement Azure Identity authentication in the Cursor extension
2. Add message serialization/deserialization for governance audit format
3. Set up daily scheduled job for end-of-day audit report generation
4. Create message processing logic for both outbound and inbound communications
5. Implement error handling with retry logic

## Security and Performance Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Using Microsoft Entra ID with Managed Identities
2. **Message Security**: All data encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2
3. **Performance**: Premium tier supports high throughput and low latency
4. **Reliability**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff recommended
5. **Monitoring**: Implement Azure Monitor alerts for error conditions
