# AI Control Implementation Process
**Date: May 9, 2025**  
**Tool: GitHub Copilot**  
**Topic: Verification Process for AI Control Implementation**

## Purpose

This document establishes a structured process with verification checkboxes to ensure all AI controls from the Cleanliness Policy are properly implemented and monitored. This process provides:

1. Clear accountability for control implementation
2. Verification checkpoints with mandatory confirmation
3. Evidence collection for compliance purposes
4. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops

## Implementation Process Overview

The implementation process follows a four-phase approach:

1. **Assessment Phase**: Evaluate current state and identify gaps
2. **Implementation Phase**: Deploy required controls and mechanisms
3. **Verification Phase**: Confirm controls are operating effectively
4. **Monitoring Phase**: Continuously monitor control effectiveness
