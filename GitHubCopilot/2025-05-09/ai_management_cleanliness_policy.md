# AI Management Board - Cleanliness Policy
**Date: May 9, 2025**  
**Tool: GitHub Copilot**  
**Topic: Operational Cleanliness & Control Implementation**

## Purpose

This document establishes a comprehensive policy for maintaining cleanliness, organization, and control within the AI Management Board project. It defines standards, responsibilities, and processes to ensure the AI system remains well-structured, secure, and maintainable as it scales.

## Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Every component, control, and process must have a clearly defined authoritative source
2. **Automated Verification**: All cleanliness and control standards must be automatically verified
3. **Continuous Compliance**: Controls are continuously monitored and enforced, not just at checkpoints
4. **Evidence-Based Implementation**: All implementations must have verifiable evidence of control effectiveness
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between monitoring, analysis, and control functions

## Domain-Specific Policies

### 1. Code Repository Management

#### 1.1 Structure Integrity
- Repository follows a consistent, documented directory structure
- Each directory serves a single, well-defined purpose
- No orphaned files or directories are permitted
- README.md files explain the purpose of each major directory

#### 1.2 Version Control Hygiene
- Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard
- No credentials, tokens, or secrets in code (enforced by pre-commit hooks)
- Branch naming follows the pattern: `[type]/[description]` (e.g., `feature/ai-monitoring-dashboard`)
- Pull requests include comprehensive descriptions and linked issues

#### 1.3 Documentation Standards
- Architecture decisions documented in ADR format
- User-facing documentation in Markdown format
- API documentation generated from code annotations
- All configuration options documented with examples

### 2. AI System Controls

#### 2.1 Context Management
- Context libraries version-controlled and centrally indexed
- Context loading/unloading operations logged for audit
- Context effectiveness measured and reported
- Regular pruning of outdated or ineffective context files

#### 2.2 Knowledge Base Integrity
- Vector embeddings regularly validated for accuracy
- Document freshness tracked and stale content flagged
- Citation tracking for all knowledge sources
- Regular validation of retrieval accuracy

#### 2.3 Conversation Monitoring
- All AI conversations captured in structured format
- PII automatically detected and redacted
- Conversation metrics tracked (duration, tokens, user satisfaction)
- Anomalous patterns automatically flagged for review

### 3. Azure Resource Management

#### 3.1 Infrastructure as Code
- All Azure resources defined in Bicep templates
- No manual resource creation in Azure portal
- All configuration changes tracked in version control
- Deployment validation through Azure what-if operations

#### 3.2 Security Standards
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all resources
- Managed identities for all service-to-service authentication
- Key Vault for all secrets management
- Network security groups properly configured

#### 3.3 Monitoring & Logging
- Azure Monitor configured for all resources
- Log Analytics workspace for centralized logging
- Custom dashboards for key operational metrics
- Alerts configured for critical thresholds

### 4. Development Process

#### 4.1 Task Management
- All work tracked in GitHub Issues or Azure DevOps
- Tasks categorized by type, priority, and complexity
- Progress tracked with defined milestones
- Regular backlog refinement sessions

#### 4.2 Quality Assurance
- Automated testing for all components
- Code review required for all changes
- Static code analysis tools integrated into CI/CD
- Regular security scanning

#### 4.3 Deployment Pipeline
- Continuous integration for all code changes
- Staged deployments (dev, test, prod)
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Deployment approval process for production

## Implementation Verification

To ensure this policy is properly implemented, the following verification mechanisms will be established:

1. **Automated Compliance Checks**: Scripts and tools that verify adherence to policy standards
2. **Regular Audits**: Scheduled reviews of all systems and processes
3. **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into compliance status
4. **Exception Management**: Process for documenting and approving policy exceptions

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **AI System** | - Self-monitoring for compliance<br>- Generating compliance reports<br>- Alerting on policy violations<br>- Recommending remediation steps |
| **Human Operators** | - Reviewing compliance reports<br>- Approving remediation actions<br>- Refining policy based on operational feedback<br>- Final decision authority for exceptions |
| **Monitoring Systems** | - Continuous verification of controls<br>- Historical compliance tracking<br>- Trend analysis<br>- Correlation of policy violations with system issues |

## Policy Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed and updated quarterly, or more frequently if significant changes to the system architecture or operational practices occur. All updates will be version-controlled and require formal approval before implementation.
