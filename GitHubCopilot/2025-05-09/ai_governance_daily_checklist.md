# AI Governance Daily Checklist
**Date: May 9, 2025**  
**Tool: GitHub Copilot**  
**Topic: Mandatory Controls for AI Systems**

## Purpose

This document establishes a comprehensive daily checklist that AI systems must complete to ensure proper governance, organization, and control. This checklist enforces critical standards across code management, context organization, knowledge integrity, conversation tracking, and implementation quality.

## Instructions for AI

1. Complete this checklist at the end of each working day or when requested
2. Provide specific evidence for each control (file paths, snippets, etc.)
3. Flag any controls that cannot be verified or are not applicable
4. Store the completed checklist in `[repository]/audits/daily/YYYY-MM-DD-governance-check.md`
5. Alert the operator of any critical failures that require immediate attention
